Acids and Bases Chemistry Lab Manual

Theory:
- Acids donate H⁺ (hydrogen ions); bases donate OH⁻ (hydroxide ions).
- Acid-base titration is used to determine the concentration of solutions.

Objective:
- To determine the concentration of acid or base using titration.

Apparatus:
- Burette, pipette, conical flask, beakers, indicators (phenolphthalein, methyl orange), acid and base solutions.

Procedure:
1. Rinse the burette with standard base. Fill it.
2. Pipette a measured amount of acid into a conical flask. Add indicator.
3. Titrate the acid by adding base slowly, swirling, until endpoint color change.
4. Record the burette reading.
5. Repeat for better accuracy.

Observations:
- Note initial and final burette readings.
- Volume of base used = Final - Initial readings.
- Record color change.

Calculations:
- Use normality equation: N1V1 = N2V2.
- Substitute known values to find unknown strength.

Precautions:
- Read burette at eye level.
- Add base dropwise near endpoint.
- Use white tile to observe color change.

Sample Viva Q&A:
Q: What is a neutralization reaction? A: Acid and base react to form salt and water.
Q: Why is phenolphthalein pink in base? A: It is colorless in acid, turns pink in base.
